Version: 0.1.0
Title: Build Fast k-Nearest Neighbor Classifiers
Description: A fast KNN learner for binary and multinomial classification
    problems, build upon the ANN library. It has been developed to deal with very
    large datasets (> 100k rows). The 'fastknn' makes it easy to find the best 'k'
    and to plot beautiful decision boundaries for the classifiers. Moreover, it
    provides estimators for the class membership probabilities based on voting and
    weighted voting. The last one gives more calibrated probabilities in general,
    and reduces log-loss.
